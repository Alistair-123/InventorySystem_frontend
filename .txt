git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
git pull
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Improve validation logic"
git push

Or specific files:

git add src/components/Navbar.tsx


git push --set-upstream origin feature/protectedRoute

The root cause is that when you create a new local branch with git checkout -b feature/protectedRoute, it only exists locally—it’s not yet linked or connected to any branch on the remote repository.

Because Git doesn’t automatically know where to push this new branch, it requires you to explicitly tell it the remote branch to track when you push for the first time.

Without setting this upstream (tracking) branch, git push has no default destination for your new branch, so it throws that error.

In short: New local branches don’t automatically have a remote counterpart or tracking setup until you push with the upstream flag.
